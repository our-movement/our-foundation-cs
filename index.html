        <p><span class="newthought">Our Foundation</span> is the legal tool with which <a href="https://our-movement.org/">Our Movement</a> interfaces with the system. It bears the responsibility of tasks such as financial affairs, legal matters, owning intellectual property, handling donations, receiving revenue from its for-profit children entities, etc.</p>
        <p>The funding that Our Foundation manages arrives from its for-profit subsidiaries, which are platforms that generate economic activity as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy" target="_blank">sharing economy</a> and utilize a <i>‘<1% Transaction Fee’</i> business model. These funds fuel Our Movement’s projects, most of which do not have business models. Transaction fees are a temporary measure and will eventually be dropped once the movement becomes sustainable through donations — fully embracing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy" target="_blank">gift economy</a>.</p>
